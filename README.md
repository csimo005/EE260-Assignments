# EE260-Assignments
A GitHub repository for my EE-260 assignments. Since we are going to be implementing a lot of stuff from scratch, I am
going to try to implement the assignments as my own deep learning framework as a gag. My end goal is for the from
scratch implementation to look as similar to pytorch as possible. Hopefully if will be an educational experience :p.
